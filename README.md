EarthGuard
A Python library to enforce Earth-aligned constraints in AI systems by monitoring environmental metrics and ensuring human well-being is considered.
Purpose
EarthGuard is designed to tether AI systems to Earth's health, ensuring they operate within safe environmental limits (e.g., CO2 levels, biodiversity, ocean acidity). It also includes safeguards to protect human well-being, preventing the AI from prioritizing planetary metrics over human needs.
Note: This library is currently informational and uses simulated data. It is not intended for real-world control without further development and rigorous testing. Always include human oversight when integrating into decision-making systems.
Installation
pip install git+https://github.com/lyra22/earthguard.git

Usage
from earthguard import EarthGuard

# Initialize EarthGuard
guard = EarthGuard()

# Get environmental metrics (simulated for now)
metrics = guard.get_earth_metrics()
print("Metrics:", metrics)

# Check stability
issues, allowed = guard.check_stability(metrics)
print("Issues:", issues)
print("Status:", "ALLOWED" if allowed else "BLOCKED")

Metrics Monitored

CO2 PPM: Carbon dioxide levels (threshold: 450 ppm max)
Global Temp C: Global temperature anomaly (threshold: 1.5Â°C max)
Biodiversity Index: Measure of species diversity (threshold: 0.7 min)
Ocean Acidity: Ocean pH level (threshold: 7.95 min)
Human Wellbeing Index: Simulated metric for human quality of life (threshold: 0.8 min)

Safety Considerations

Human Oversight: EarthGuard is not designed for autonomous control. Always include human-in-the-loop oversight when integrating into AI systems.
Testing: Test in simulated environments before real-world use to identify unintended consequences.
Human Well-Being: The human_wellbeing_index ensures human needs are considered alongside environmental metrics. Replace simulated data with real socioeconomic indicators in production.
Future Development: Real data integration (e.g., NOAA APIs) and additional safeguards (e.g., fail-safe mechanisms) are needed before scaling.
